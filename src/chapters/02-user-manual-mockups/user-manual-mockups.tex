We have three actors
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Unregistered User
    \item Reader
    \item Administrator
\end{enumerate}

Both unregistered and registered users are end users of the application. Unregistered users have limited access to the system; they cannot receive personalized recommendations, like or follow authors, or connect with other readers who share similar interests.

Registered users, on the other hand, can fully utilize the application’s features. They can view personalized recommendations, track their reading history, access user activity analytics, explore popular books, and interact with other readers with similar tastes.

Administrators are responsible for managing registered users and maintaining the book-related data within the application.
